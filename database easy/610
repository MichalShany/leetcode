610. Triangle Judgement
Easy
 
SQL Schema
A pupil Tim gets homework to identify whether three line segments could possibly form a triangle.
 

However, this assignment is very heavy because there are hundreds of records to calculate.
 

Could you help Tim by writing a query to judge whether these three sides can form a triangle, assuming table triangle holds the length of the three sides x, y and z.
 

| x  | y  | z  |
|----|----|----|
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
For the sample data above, your query should return the follow result:
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
|----|----|----|----------|
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |


SELECT x, y, z,
CASE WHEN x+y<=z OR
          x+z<=y OR
          y+z<=x
     THEN 'No'
     ELSE 'Yes'
END AS 'triangle'
FROM triangle;


SELECT *, IF(x+y>z and x+z>y and y+z>x, 'Yes', 'No') as triangle FROM triangle


select x,y,z,
case when x+y <= z THEN 'No'
    when y+z <= x THEN 'No' 
    when z+x <= y then 'No' 
    else 'Yes' END as `triangle`
from triangle;
